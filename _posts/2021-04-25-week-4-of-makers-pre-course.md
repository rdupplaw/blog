This was the final week of the pre-course. Next week we'll start the course proper. I finished off a few things from the pre-course and did some extra studying about Git.

## Student directory command line program

The last activity for the pre-course was a command line program called directory.rb. This tutorial showed us how to put together the Ruby we've learned so far into an application made up of several functions. The program keeps a list of fictional students and prints information about them.

The tutorial demonstrated how to put a basic project together from scratch, writing and refactoring then adding additional features. We applied the DRY principle by extracting code to methods so it can be reused. We also learned how to take command line arguments and how to save data to a CSV for persistence.

## Git Immersion

Git Immersion is a Git tutorial that takes you through the key features of Git. It covers, among other things: creating a repo, staging and committing changes, reverting commits and resetting HEAD, amending a commit, creating and merging branches, resolving conflicts, rebasing, cloning, fetching, pulling and pushing.

The key feature of this tutorial is that you run every command in your own terminal and can play around with the repos on your machine, experimenting with different commands and options to see how they work beyond just what the tutorial shows you.
