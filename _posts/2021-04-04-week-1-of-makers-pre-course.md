## Meeting my cohort

This week I got to know my cohort over Slack. It's nice to see everyone sharing their problems or progress and helping each other.

A couple of people on my cohort are also blogging about their experience of the course, which you can see [here](https://jennylouisebell.medium.com/nerd-for-life-starting-my-coding-journey-689e722b0789) and [here](https://jonny-kelly.medium.com/from-management-to-maker-reshaping-my-career-into-software-development-e2ec4aae1167).

## What we learned

This week we learned about the Linux/macOS command line (Bash/Zsh) and command line programs, with an emphasis on Git.

We were introduced to several basic, but important, commands: ls, cd, rm, cat, grep, chmod etc. We also learned about some features of Bash, like pipelines, redirection and profiles, as well as some Linux/macOS concepts like file permissions.

In Git, we learned about the concepts of repositories, staging, committing, branching and merging (and the commands for all of these: git init, git add, git commit, git merge etc.). We also touched upon GitHub, a repository of Git repositories, where we can share code. You can also fork a GitHub repository to get your own version to work on, then submit a pull request to merge your changes into the original repository.

The material covered was not too difficult and I'd seen a lot of it before, but it's important to get the basics down properly before we move onto more complicated topics.

## Moving on

In the coming two weeks we'll be diving into (procedural) Ruby, learning the fundamentals: data types, syntax, built-in methods and control flow among other concepts and features.
